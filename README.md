# 🌐 Personal-Website

## Project Description

👉 **Live Website:** [My Website](https://joyal-paul.onrender.com) </br>
This is my dynamic personal portfolio website built with the Django web framework. This website was deployed and is hosted through Render.com. </br>

⚠️ **NOTE**: Render does take a minute or more to deploy my website after it goes inactive for 15+ min, so if you are in a rush, just click the thumbnail for the demo video below.

### 🛠 Teck Stack

 - Django-framework in Python (Backend) 
 - HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Frontend)
 - Gunicorn / WhiteNoise (deployment assistance library)
 - Render.com [Free Tier] for deployment and hosting

### 📱 Extra

The display for Ipad screens are still in progress, so I highly recommend veiwing this on a cell phone, laptop, or PC screen. Also, Render.com's free tier takes time to deploy so feel free to look at the demo video if you don't want to wait the minute or two it takes to deploy. Finally, SUBSCRIBE if you want to be updated with any more projects, tutorials, etc. that are on the way!
